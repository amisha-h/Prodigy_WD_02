During my internship, I developed a Stopwatch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project involved creating a functional and interactive stopwatch where users can start, pause, reset, and record lap times. I implemented the layout with HTML and styled it using CSS, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface with a custom background image. In JavaScript, I focused on building the core functionality, including real-time time updates using `setInterval` and handling user interactions with event listeners. I also created a lap feature that dynamically records lap times while the stopwatch is running. This project helped me deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and time-based functions in JavaScript. Additionally, I enhanced my CSS skills by working on responsive layouts and button styling. Overall, this experience was a valuable opportunity.
